# Friendly: Roadmap
## Features
### Birthday Notifications

Users should be able to receive day-of notifications of important birthdays.

"Upcoming" should be a configurable value.

Users should be able to add ideas for a friend's birthday.
For example: 'Apollo Lego Rocket' (with Amazon link) for Josh.

## Interfaces
### SMS
As of right now, SMS is the primary platform for Friendly - simply because I don't look at push notifications with the same frequency.

### Potential interfaces
#### Messaging
- Facebook Messenger
- RCS [Rich Communications Service](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2018/02/rcs.html)

#### Apps
In order of preference: 
- Flutter
- Android Native & iOS Native

Right now I don't see a need for a mobile app, but perhaps other features will drive their necessity.

I don't think this would ever need to be a desktop app.
